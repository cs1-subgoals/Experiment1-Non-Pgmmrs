    <p>Problem: Write the Python conditionals to solve the following specifications:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If integer variable <c>current</c> is odd, change its value so that it is now 4 times <c>current</c> plus 1; otherwise change its value so that it is now half of <c>current</c> (rounded down when <c>current</c> is odd).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-write-conSG1">
        <title>1. Define how many mutually exclusive paths are needed</title>
        <p>In this case, the problem says to do one action if variable is odd, and a different
            action otherwise.</p>
        <p>An integer can only be odd or even, so there are two mutually exclusive paths.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-write-conSG2">
        <title>2. Order paths from most restrictive to least restrictive</title>
        <p>Since there are only two branches, the order does not matter.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-write-conSG3">
        <title>3. Write conditional statement with Boolean expression</title>
        <p>To determine if the <c>current</c> variable is odd, we can check that the remainder
            (modulo) after dividing by 2 is one:</p>
        <program language="python">
            <input>
if current % 2 == 1:

            </input>
        </program>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-write-conSG4">
        <title>4. Follow with true path including action in indentation</title>
        <p>In the True branch, we multiply the variable by 4 and add 1.</p>
        <program language="python">
            <input>if current % 2 == 1:
    current = current * 4 + 1</input>
        </program>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-write-conSG5">
        <title>5. Repeat 3 and 4 until all paths are included</title>
        <p>N/A since there is only the true and else path, which is below.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-write-conSG6">
        <title>6. (Optional) Follow with else path including action in indentation</title>
        <p>In the else branch, we change the value to be half of its current value. We must make
            sure we keep the result as an integer, so we use integer division.</p>
        <program language="python">
            <input>
if current % 2 == 1:
    current = current * 4 + 1
else:
    current //= 2</input>
        </program>
        <answer>
        <program language="python">
            <input>
if current % 2 == 1:
    current = current * 4 + 1
else:
    current //= 2
            </input>
