Define how many mutually exclusive paths are needed  In this case, the problem says to do one action if variable is odd, and a different action otherwise.  An integer can only be odd or even, so there are two mutually exclusive paths.    2. Order paths from most restrictive to least restrictive  Since there are only two branches, the order does not matter.    3. Write conditional statement with Boolean expression  To determine if the current variable is odd, we can check that the remainder (modulo) after dividing by 2 is one:   if current % 2 == 1:     4. Follow with true path including action in indentation  In the True branch, we multiply the variable by 4 and add 1.   if current % 2 == 1: current = current * 4 + 1     5. Repeat 3 and 4 until all paths are included  N\/A since there is only the true and else path, which is below.    6. (Optional) Follow with else path including action in indentation  In the else branch, we change the value to be half of its current value. We must make sure we keep the result as an integer, so we use integer division.   if current % 2 == 1: current = current * 4 + 1 else: current \/\/= 2     if current % 2 == 1: current = current * 4 + 1 else: current \/\/= 2    "

Determine purpose of loop to pick loop structure (for, while)  Generally, while loops are a good choice for sentinel loops, since you cannot know up front how many times the code will need to iterate.    2. Define variables before loop that have dependencies within the loop  The user must input at least one number in order for us to find a maximum. The variable user_input will also be used as the loop control variable, so we must define it before the loop begins.   user_input = int(input(\"Enter a value, enter -1 to end.\"))   The maximum value must be updated during the loop based on its previous value, and will be printed after the loop, so that variable will need to be initialized prior to the loop.   maximum = user_input     3. Based on loop structure  The terminiation condition for this loop is when the user's inputted value is equal to the sentinel. We need to invert that condition to identify the continuation condition instead. That continuation condition must involve the loop control variable, which in this case will be user_input .   while user_input != -1:     4. Write loop body  First, we must check whether the latest maximum is greater than the user_input ; if so, we must update the maximum . This check is unnecessary during the first iteration of the loop, but is critical on every subsequent iteration.   while user_input != -1: if user_input > maximum: maximum = user_input   We then need to update the user_input loop control variable so that the loop has a chance to end at some point based on the user's value.   while user_input != -1: if user_input > maximum: maximum = user_input user_input = int(input(\"Enter a value, enter -1 to end.\"))     user_input = int(input(\"Enter a value, enter -1 to end.\")) maximum = user_input while user_input != -1: if user_input > maximum: maximum = user_input user_input = int(input(\"Enter a value, enter -1 to end.\")) print(maximum)     "
